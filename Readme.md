### FAQ
- Q: When would you update charts?
> A: as far as I obtain files from other public places including bbs, dm, etc., but I will not put them right away if I consider it was too new to put it here (`n-0`, which I never had a chance to get any).

- Q: Links expired!
> A: Naturally GitHub links wouldn't expire. If `mega` links expired, start a issue here and I will reupload as soon as possible.

- Q: Can you upload files to somewhere else?
> A: I am not considering uploading to any other platforms that were too easy to get my resources blocked, but you are more than welcome to reupload - do cite me if possible

- Q: I want background videos (BGA). Can you upload them?
> A: I do have converts with BGA, but that copy is pretty large - 20GB+, which exceeds most platforms' free plans. Please consider using `MaichartConverter` to intergrate videos if you already have them.
